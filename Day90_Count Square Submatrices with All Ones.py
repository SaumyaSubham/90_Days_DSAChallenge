# Count Square Submatrices with All Ones                Difficulty = Medium


# Given a m * n matrix of ones and zeros, return how many square submatrices have all ones.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: matrix =
# [
#   [0,1,1,1],
#   [1,1,1,1],
#   [0,1,1,1]
# ]
# Output: 15
# Explanation: 
# There are 10 squares of side 1.
# There are 4 squares of side 2.
# There is  1 square of side 3.
# Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.
# Example 2:

# Input: matrix = 
# [
#   [1,0,1],
#   [1,1,0],
#   [1,1,0]
# ]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: 
# There are 6 squares of side 1.  
# There is 1 square of side 2. 
# Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.

        dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)] # new int[m+1][n+1];
        ans = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j]:
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = min(dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j]) + 1
                    ans += dp[i+1][j+1]
        return ans
